        <span class="about-value">Exceptionally engineered systems</span><br>
        We are a team of engineers and designers, and we hold the products
        we craft to the highest standard. We believe that exceptionally
        engineered systems &mdash; not marble office buildings on Wall St
        &mdash; are the cornerstones of establishing trust.
      </p>

      <p class="mtx">
        <span class="about-value">Simplicity</span><br>
        Today there is a complex system of regulation, financial institutions,
        and assets that can seem daunting to a newcomer. Making Robinhood
        simple, focused, and immediately understandable is hard work. But we
        believe that by sticking to this goal, we can make something really
        special.
      </p>

      <p class="mtx">
        <span class="about-value">
          Individual participation in equity markets
        </span><br>
        The stock market is one of the best available tools for individual
        wealth creation, generating annual returns of around 10% over the
        past century. Our mission is to empower this new generation to take
        greater ownership in their financial future, which we believe can
        help shrink the gap between the "haves" and the "have nots" and lead
        to a healthier, more robust global economy.

      <p class="mtl lead white-text">
        After graduating from Stanford, roommates Vladimir Tenev and Baiju
        Bhatt moved to New York, where they built trading platforms for
        some of the largest financial institutions in the
        world. They began to realize that electronic trading firms pay
        effectively nothing to place trades in the market yet charge
        investors up to $10 for each trade &mdash; and thus the idea for
        Robinhood was born. They soon ventured back to California to begin
        solving the problem of democratizing access to the markets.

Zero-dollar ($0) commissions are available for Robinhood Financial
self-directed individual cash or margin brokerage accounts that trade U.S.
listed securities via mobile devices. Please see our
<a

  target="_blank">
  Commission and Fee Schedule</a>.
<br><br>
      

Robinhood is currently registered in the following
<a
  href="https://brokerage-static.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20Jurisdictions.pdf"
  target="_blank">jurisdictions</a>.
This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell
securities, or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Robinhood is
not registered. Getting &quot;early access&quot; to Robinhood is defined as
signing up with a valid email address for a spot in Robinhood's waitlist queue.
You can improve your spot in the queue each time you refer someone who signs
up with a valid email address. There is no limitation on the number of
referrals you can make and the number of positions you can move in line.
Residents of jurisdictions where Robinhood is registered will be notified
first, based on their current position in line and will be given an invitation
to access Robinhood's brokerage account opening application process. Early
access to Robinhood's waitlist queue should in no way be construed as
confirmation that a brokerage account has been opened or will even be approved
for opening.
<br><br>
      All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, or
financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind
that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, or
protect against loss, in a down market. There is always the potential of losing
money when you invest in securities, or other financial products. Investors
should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before
investing.
<br><br>
      

Margin trading involves interest charges and risks, including the potential to
lose more than deposited or the need to deposit additional collateral in a
falling market. Before using margin, customers must determine whether this
type of trading strategy is right for them given their specific investment
objectives, experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation. For more
information please see our

      Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to
risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse
ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to
volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives
and other complex investment strategies.

Although ETFs are designed to
provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of
their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate
the performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors.  A
prospectus contains this and other information about the ETF and should be read
carefully before investing.  Customers should obtain prospectuses from issuers
and/or their third party agents who distribute and make prospectuses available
for review.  ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders
at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the need
to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also generate tax
consequences.  Additional regulatory guidance on Exchange Traded Products can
